# es Page heading

<p class="usa-intro"> 
es The page heading communicates the main focus of the page. Make your page heading descriptive and keep it succinct.
</p>

## es Section heading

es These headings introduce, respectively, sections and subsections within your body copy. As you create these headings, follow the same guidelines that you use when writing section headings: Be succinct, descriptive, and precise.

### es Subsection heading

es The particulars of your body copy will be determined by the topic of your page. Regardless of topic, it’s a good practice to follow the inverted pyramid structure when writing copy: Begin with the information that’s most important to your users and then present information of less importance.

Keep each section and subsection focused - a good approach is to include one theme (topic) per section.

#### es Subsection heading

es Use the side navigation menu to help your users quickly skip to different sections of your page. The menu is best suited to displaying a hierarchy with one to three levels and, as we mentioned, to display the sub-navigation of a given page.
